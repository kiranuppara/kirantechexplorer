            Hello there! I'm Sai <span>Kiran</span>, extending a warm digital welcome to you. Nestled in the
            vibrant town of Hindupur, Andhra Pradesh, I invite you to join me on a fascinating journey through the
            realms of technology, entrepreneurship, and beyond. <img class="first" src="images/intro-1.jpg" alt="first pic"> </p> 
        
            
            <p class="intro-2"> My path in the tech landscape was illuminated by a
                Bachelor's in Technology, specialized in Computer Science, from SV University (2020-23). This journey began
                with a diploma in Computer Science from B I T Institute of Technology (2017-20), where I ignited my passion
                for technological innovation.  </p> <img class="second" src="images/intro-2.jpg" alt="second pic">
            <p class="intro-3">Professionally, I've had the privilege of donning the hat of a Software Development Engineer (SDE) at a
                product-based company. This role has been a testament to my dedication and drive in the ever-evolving tech
                sphere.
    
                Away from screens and coding, my heart finds solace in the rhythm of a football on a 7-foot pitch. The
                exhilaration of the game fuels my competitive spirit and offers a refreshing perspective. Technology isn't
                confined to work—I'm constantly exploring the digital world, seeking inspiration from the myriad of
                possibilities it offers. </p><img class="third" src="images/intro-3.jpg" alt="third pic">
           
            <p class="intro-4">  
                But life isn't just about technology; it's about the connections we forge. Hanging out with friends is a
                cherished escape, where laughter and shared experiences become cherished memories. Cooking is another realm
                where my creativity flourishes. Experimenting with flavors and techniques is my way of blending innovation
                into everyday life.
    
                Beyond these experiences, my aspirations stretch towards becoming a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of a
                company, a goal that guides my journey and shapes my decisions.  </p><img class="first" src="images/intro-4.jpg" alt="first pic">
            <p class="intro-5">
                My mission is resolute—to harness the power of technology, creativity, and friendship to shape a future
                that's both innovative and inclusive.  this
                platform isn't just a showcase; it's a hub for sharing insights, sparking connections, and fostering growth. </p> 
         
                
          

            <p class="intro-6">

                As you navigate this space, I hope you find inspiration in the convergence of technology and everyday
                experiences. Thank you for joining me on this vibrant adventure, where every click bridges the gap between
                aspirations and achievements. <br>
